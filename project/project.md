## Abstract

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. We're challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

## 1. Introduction

Our objective is to predict the natural log of total revenue per customer which is a real valued continuous output and linear regression would be an ideal algorithm in such a setting to predict the response variable that is continuous using a set of predictor variables given the basic assumption that there is a linear relationship between the predictor and response variables.

## 2. Datasets

- <https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction>

The dataset we used is from the Kaggle Competition. The dataset contains two csv files.
- Train.csv, User transactions from August 1st, 2016 to August 1st, 2017, 903.6K records
- Test.csv, User transactions from August 2nd, 2017 to April 30th, 2018, 804.6K records


The metrics we will use for this project is root mean squared error (RMSE). The root mean squared error function forms our objective/cost function which will be minimized to estimate the optimal parameters for our linear function through Gradient Descent. We will conduct multiple experiments to obtain convergence using different "number of iterations" value and other hyper-parameters (e.g. learning rate).

RMSE is defined as:

![Figure 2.1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-337/raw/master/project/images/loss.png)  

where y-hat is the natural log of the predicted revenue for a customer and y is the natural log of the actual summed revenue value plus one as seen below.


## 3. Machine Learning Algorithm and Implementation

We used CRISP-DM process methodology for this project. The  high-level representation of the implementation steps explained in detail below:

- Get Data

The data was obtained from Kaggle Competition. Please find the details of the dataset in the above section

- Load Data
	-  <https://storage.googleapis.com/gstoretrain/train.csv>
	-  <https://storage.googleapis.com/gstoretrain/test.csv>

	The data we obtained from Kaggle was over 2.6 GB (for Train and Test). As the size of the dataset was large, I created a storage bucket in GCP to host the data. The URL is provided above for your reference	

- Data Exploration

The dataset we obtained contained 54 Independent Variable and 1 Dependent variable. The Dependent Variable is totals.transactionRevenue. The end goal of this project is to predict the revenue of the Online Store Customer as close as possible.

- Data Pre-Processing

The dataset obtained for this project is large. It certainly contained over 900k records in just the training set. Also some of the columns contained null values as well. So, we first visualized the target variable and identified the target variable was a skewed variable. So applied log transformations to get the data to be distributed normally. The variables such as "totals_newVisits", "totals_bounces", "trafficSource_adwordsClickInfo_page", "trafficSource_isTrueDirect", "totals_bounces", "totals_newVisits" had missing values. We applied zeroes to all the missing values. 

- Feature Engineering

Created sophisticated functions to encode categorical variables. As this is regression problem, we need the dataset to be encoded categorically, so all the categories can be converted as numeric fields. We also created other functions to process date time, extract sum, count and mean from numeric variables such as "geoNetwork_networkDomain", "totals_hits" 

- Model Algorithms and Optimization Methods

I tested the following algorithms 

- Linear Regression Model

- XGBoost Regressor

- LightGBM Regressor

- Lasso Regression

- Ridge Regressor

- Results Validation

I found the XGBoost Method to have the lowest RMSE error.
