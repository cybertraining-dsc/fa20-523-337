## Abstract

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. We're challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data [^1].

## 1. Introduction

Our objective is to predict the natural log of total revenue per customer which is a real valued continuous output and linear regression would be an ideal algorithm in such a setting to predict the response variable that is continuous using a set of predictor variables given the basic assumption that there is a linear relationship between the predictor and response variables.

## 2. Datasets

- [Kaggle - Customer Revenue Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction)

The dataset we used is from the Kaggle Competition. The dataset contains two csv files.

- Train.csv, User transactions from August 1st, 2016 to August 1st, 2017, 903.6K records
- Test.csv, User transactions from August 2nd, 2017 to April 30th, 2018, 804.6K records

CITATIONS TO DATA MISSING


The metrics we will use for this project is root mean squared error (RMSE). The root mean squared error function forms our objective/cost function which will be minimized to estimate the optimal parameters for our linear function through Gradient Descent. We will conduct multiple experiments to obtain convergence using different "number of iterations" value and other hyper-parameters (e.g. learning rate).

RMSE is defined as:

CAPTION MISSING

where y-hat is the natural log of the predicted revenue for a customer and y is the natural log of the actual summed revenue value plus one as seen below.


## 3. Methodology

We used CRISP-DM process methodology for this project. The  high-level implementation steps is shown in the image below:

THIS IS NOT PPT

- Get Data

The data was obtained from Kaggle Competition. Please find the details of the dataset in the above section

- Load Data
	- [Kaggle - Customer Revenue Prediction - Train Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/gstoretrain/train.csv)
	- [Kaggle - Customer Revenue Prediction - Test Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/gstoretrain/test.csv)

	The data we obtained from Kaggle was over 2.6 GB (for Train and Test). As the size of the dataset was large, I created a storage bucket in GCP to host the data. The URL is provided above for your reference.Also for this project we are using only the Train data to build our models and test the results because the real end goal is to test the effectiveness of algorithm. Since the test set doesnt contain the Target Variable (rightly so!), we won't be consuming the test set for our analysis.	

- Data Exploration

The dataset obtained for this project is large.  It had contained over 900k records. The dataset also contained 12 Independent Variable and 1 Dependent variable. The Dependent Variable is totals.transactionRevenue. 
The end goal of this project is to predict the revenue of the Online Store Customer as close as possible.

- Target Variable

The Target Variable is totals.transactionRevenue has the transaction value of each visit. But, this column contains 98.72% of missing values for revenue (no purchase). The Target variable had a skewed distribution, we performed a lognormal distribution, so the target variable has normal distribution.

- Data Pre-Processing

Data Pre-Processing is an important step to build a Machine Learning Model. The data pre-processing step typically consists of data cleaning, transformation, standardization and feature selection, so only the most cleaner and accurate data is fed to the models. The dataset we obtained for this project was noticed to contain several data issues such as missing values, less to no variance (zero variance) in the data and also identified the target variable not having random distribution.  The variables such as "totals_newVisits", "totals_bounces", "trafficSource_adwordsClickInfo_page", "trafficSource_isTrueDirect", "totals_bounces", "totals_newVisits" had missing values. We handled the missing values with "zeroes", so the ML algorithms doesn't face any issues. This is a very important step in building the Machine Learning Pipeline. 

- Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is the process of extracting the hidden signals/features, so the model can use these features to increase the predictive power. This step is the fundamental difference between a good model and a bad model. Also, there is no one-size-fits all approach for Feature Engineering. It is extremely time consuming and requires a lot of domain knowledge as well. 
For this project, we created sophisticated functions to extract date related values such as Month, Year, Data, Weekday, WeekofYear. We also noticed that browser and operating systems are redundant features. Instead of removing them, we combined them to create a combinational feature, so we believe this will increase the predictive power. We also calculated "mean", "sum" and "count" for pageviews and hits, so it can provide more powerful extraction of the feature to the model.

- Feature Selection

Feature Selection refers to selection of features in your data that would improve your machine learning model. There is subtle variation between Feature Selection and Feature Engineering. The Feature Engineering technique is designed to extract more feature from the dataset and the feature selection technique allows only relevant features into the dataset. Also, how do we know what are the relevant features? There are several methodologies and techniques that are developed over the years but there is no one-size-fits-all methodology. 

Feature Selection like Feature Engineering is more of an art than science. There are several iterative procedure that uses Information Gain, Entropy and Correlation scores to decide which feature gets into the model. There are also advanced Deep learning models that can be built or tree based models that can also provide us which of these variables are significant after the model is built. Similar to Feature Engineering, Feature Selection should also require domain specific knowledge to develop festure selection strategies.

For this project, we dropped the features which had no variance in the data and the features that had a lot of null values as well. These features would have not added any value to the dataset. Also, depending on the final result, we can try different strategies in the future to improve the performance of the model.

- Prepare the data

Scikit learn has inbuilt libraries to handle Train/Test Split as part the "model_selection" package. We split the dataset randomly with 80% Training and 20% Testing datasets. 

- Model Algorithms and Optimization Methods

We tested several different Machine Learning Models as shown below. The results of each step and their settings are explained in their respective sections:

- Linear Regression Model
	
	SKLearn Linear Regression performed well overall. We used 5 fold CV. The best RMSE Score for this model we obtained was: 1.89. Also the training and test scores seems to be very close and so we don't suspect any overfitting.

- XGBoost Regressor
	
	XGBoost Linear Regression performed very well. It was our top performing model with the lowest RMSE error of 1.619. Also the training and test scores seems to be little different and so might have produce overfitting. I tested multiple rounds with different parameters, this was the best performing model overall.

- LightGBM Regressor	
	
	LightGBM Regression was the second best performing model interms of RMSE Scores.  Also the training and test scores seems to be little different and so might have produce overfitting. I tested multiple rounds with different parameters, this was the best performing model overall.

## 7. Conclusion

Ã§ WHY USE THIS CHAR?

Ã§ for majority of the Machine Learning projects. We wanted to create a template so it can utilized for any ML projects. The dataset we obtained for this project was a bit challenging because a lot of data cleaning, flattening and transformations were required to get the data in the required format. 

We also performed feature enngineering in this dataset to get more predicitve value out of the features and built a pipeline, so it can be easily fed into different models. We tested five different models. They are: Linear Regression, XGBoost, Light GBM, Lasso and Ridge. The summary of all the models is shown below for your reference:

![Model_Results](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-337/raw/main/project/images/model_results_new.png)

**Figure - Model Results Summary DOES NOT FOLLOW TEMPLATE** 


XGBoost had the best performance with the lowest RMSE scores. We recommend using the XGBoost model to be tested with real time data so, the performance of the model can be evaluated in realtime and additionally, if required, hyper parameter tuning can be performed on the XGBoost model. 

### Future Considerations

THIS IS NOT PPT

- Due to the limited capacity of our Colab Notebook setup, we were unable to perform Cross Validation for XGBoost and Light GBM. We recommend to perform cross validation for these models, check the RMSE Scores and potentially avoid overfitting, if any.
- The tree based models performed well in this dataset. In the future try additional tree based models like Random Forest to evaluate their performance
